# microservice-sipgenerator

This microservice provides functionality to create a Submission Information Package (SIP) which can be ingested into a long-term archival system. Currently we are supporting the ExLibris/Rosetta system format. In future an independent format will be added, called the 'BagIT' format.


## Setup & Installation

The deployment setup is based on the repository [microservice-base](http://github.com/DURAARK/microservice-base). It provides development scripts and docker deployment. Have a look at the link to get more detailed information.

Enjoy!
